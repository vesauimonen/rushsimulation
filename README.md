Rush simulation
===============
Simulation of a rush when individuals are trying to get out of a room as fast as possible. Done as a university course project trying to mimic Craig W. Reynolds' Java applet in http://www.red3d.com/cwr/steer/Doorway.html. Highly inspired by Reynolds' great article titled *Steering Behaviors For Autonomous Characters* (http://www.red3d.com/cwr/steer/gdc99/).

Requirements
------------
- Python 2.7
- Kivy >= 1.5.1 (http://kivy.org/)

Run
---
Run the simulation by executing `kivy main.py`
